## Tech

Metacogg uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [reactjs](https://reactjs.org/)
- [redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Twitter Bootstrap]
- [node.js]
- [Express]
- [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)


And of course Metacogg App itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/elgaridlo/metacogg)
 on GitHub.
